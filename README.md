# Milan Šović, Daniel Elero, Igor Dejanović: Current Developments in Tooling and Editor Support in textX

textX[1] is a meta-language for building Domain-Specific Languages in Python.
Inspired by Xtext, it leverages Python's dynamic nature to provide a more
lightweight approach to building DSLs and parsers.

In this talk, after a brief introduction to textX, we will focus on recent
developments in tooling and editor support. The new textX playground[2] will be
presented, allowing users to interactively create grammars and experiment with
programs/models. Additionally, we will showcase developments in support for the
Language Server Protocol and VS Code integration for textX languages[3].

The presentation of new features will be conducted through a live demo of
building a small DSL for drone navigation. The code and instructions for the
demo will be available on the project site and Git repository.
